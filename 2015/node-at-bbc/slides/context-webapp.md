# What is a<br> **Web app**?

@@@

A Web app is a *browser rendering* of some *HTML code* served by an *HTTP server*,
which itself is compiled or *interpreted* by a *program* before being provisioned
on a *computer machine*.

<small>(Eventually, the data transit safely transit between the end user and the servers,
  without being captured by a third party â€“ even if funded by our taxes)</small>
