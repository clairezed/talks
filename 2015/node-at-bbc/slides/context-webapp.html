<h1>What is a<br> <strong>Web app</strong>?</h1>
<p>@@@</p>
<p>A Web app is a <em>browser rendering</em> of some <em>HTML code</em> served by an <em>HTTP server</em>,
which itself is compiled or <em>interpreted</em> by a <em>program</em> before being provisioned
on a <em>computer machine</em>.</p>
<p><small>(Eventually, the data transit safely transit between the end user and the servers,
without being captured by a third party – even if funded by our taxes)</small></p>
