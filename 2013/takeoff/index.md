Google Apps Scripts is a hidden replacing gem without having to buy a SAP licence.

JavaScript is the definitive language to build scripts, deploy simple & complex workflows using your companyâ€™s Google Apps services and datas: retrieve from third party providers (like Twitter), host in Spreadsheets, publish to Calendar, notify with emails and more.
