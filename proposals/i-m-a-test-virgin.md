# I'm a Test Virgin

You heard about *that* famous moment. A moment with a before and an after. A moment you never forget because you definitely become an adult.

You know about the theory but you never practiced and worse, you don't know the gap between the fiction and the reality. Why is it so difficult?

So you end up asking your parents: "Hey, how have you written your first test?"

Today you date a software programme, and you'd like to know your way to commit your first taste.  
Because testing sooner is better than later!
