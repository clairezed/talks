# I'm a Test Virgin

You heard about *that* famous moment. A moment with a before and an after. A moment you never forget because you definitely become an adult.

You know about the theory but you never practiced. Worse: you don't even know what is the gap between the fiction and the reality. Why is it so difficult?

So you end up asking your parents: "Hey, how have you written your first test ever?"

Today, you have a date with a software programme, and you'd like to know your way to commit your first test.  
Because testing sooner is better than later!
