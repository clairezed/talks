# README Driven Development

The README file is the ASL of every software project : it has to be informative about what the software is, how to install it, how to use it and eventually how to contribute to it.

What if you would start your project by writing a full README before any line of code? We'll see it is like pair programming with yourself, a way to get early feedback and even a way to clear your mind about what you are trying to achieve, for a better code quality.
