# README Driven Development

TDD, BDD, DDD or WTFDD… this is nice but is it helping our teams to start faster on Day 1?

Let's go back to something even simpler and even more essential than a naming: communication.

As we hate specs and like to KISS, let's write documentation first, including examples and intentions.
We'll be surprised it's just easier to detect inconsistencies and to share our vision before writing a single line of code.

As a bonus, it works pretty well for Pull Requests too!
