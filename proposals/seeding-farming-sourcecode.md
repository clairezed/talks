# On seeding and farming our source code

I never considered myself being an Open Source developer.
But I have always learned and benefited from the Open Source nebula. So I naturally shared back, through blog posts, talks or  code.

Although Open Source seems nice in theory, promoting this philosophy in an organisation can be tricky: success leads to business, openness leads to protection and exposure leads to a fear of failure.

So how do we do Open Source, especially in a large organisation like the BBC? How can we plant the seeds of an organic and natural change without hurting the business nor damaging ours revenues?
