# Seeding and farming Open Source code at the BBC

I never considered myself being an Open Source developer.
But I have always learned and benefited from the Open Source nebula. So I naturally shared back, through blog posts, talks or  code.

Although Open Source seems nice in theory, promoting this philosophy in an organisation can be tricky: success leads to business, openness leads to protection and exposure leads to a fear of failure.

So how do we do Open Source, especially in a large organisation like the BBC? How can we plant the seeds of an organic and natural change without hurting the business nor damaging ours revenues?

We will through examples how projects like Imager.js, Peaks.js and TAL benefited from an Open Source collaboration between teams and external contributors. For the best.
