# On seeding and farming our source code

Amongst users and consumers of open source softwares, I often encounter a silent majority of people who have genuine reasons to avoid open sourcing software.

One does feel it is not useful enough. One does have no reason to change their habit. One does need to make money. One simply does not trust those hippy developers.

I would like to show that creating and maintaining open source software is *not so different* from any daily programming habits.

As a **person**: it will make you learn, give you confidence and acceptation.
As a **culture**: it will bring discoverability, communication and explicitness amongst the code.
As a **company**: nothing prevents to make money *and* to be open at the same time.
