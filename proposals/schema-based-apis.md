# Schema-based APIs

> People often refer to Swagger as a great tool to build documentation from your code.
>
> I think the real strength lies in the OpenAPI schema descriptions which is to me, the README of your API: which routes respond what, what are the models supposed to come it and to be spit out your pipes?
>
> And finally, we interface the schema with validation tools, controllers and hook it up with AWS API Gateway to combine multiple APIs under a same umbrella.
