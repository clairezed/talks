# Going Dynamic to Static to Improve Collaboration

Running a content oriented collaborative website is grateful when people contributes.
Most of the efforts implied are related to the following:

- creating a backend system
- creating a moderation system
- handling images sizes
- enable feedback from users
- displaying and linking content
- hosting and maintaining the platform to catch up with technology evolution

Nowadays, a lot of these tasks are covered by mature services:

- Github: content storage, content moderation, feedback and even hosting
- Grunt: content assembler, routine tasks
- Template Engine (like Handlebars): dynamic and contextual output of data

Here is how I converted a PHP/MySQL into a 17K files website; leveraging even more the contribution.
