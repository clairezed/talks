# Creating a Grunt Task from Spaghetti to Rock Solid Code

We have an idea, we code it as a custom task in our `Gruntfile.js` andâ€¦ *it works*!

Then you sleep on it for 6 months and someone stumble on you, revealing some software weakness you had trouble to fix because you don't remember well what was your state of mind at the time of writing the code.

This is not bad. This is how it often works in the real world.  
We will learn how to make that code beautifully speaking by itself, embracing a *design features* approach rather than the *code stuff tested on runtime* one.

And if you never wrote unit tests, this is definitely the trigger which will break your fear and share your knowledge of your code across your team.

## Targeted audience

* (JavaScript) Developer
* People inclined to learn about improving quality, by coding or infusing the idea in their team
