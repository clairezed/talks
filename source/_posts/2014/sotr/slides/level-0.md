Because this is how it was back in the days.

How did you enforce a JavaScript code style in 2010?
How did you check the sanity of the code before deploying it?

We delegated what we could delegate to tools like YUICompressor or Sass. When they eventually became available.

You needed to have the proper version of Java to be available in the `$PATH`. You needed the proper command line arguments to be given to those tools.

Writing a `Makefile` was probably the best solution to hide the complexity. (If you were not using Windows).
